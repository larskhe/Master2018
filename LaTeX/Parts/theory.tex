\section{Brief Introduction to Semiconductors}

In the world of material science, semiconductors have occupied researchers for centuries and the fascination continues to this day. According to \citet{Busch1989} the word \textit{semiconductor} was first mentioned by Alessandro Volta in 1782 \textit{"...in a paper read in English before the Royal Society in London on 14 March 1782"}.\citep{Busch1989} Later, Michael Faraday would prove the semiconducting properties of materials by showing that increasing temperature could drastically increase the conductivity in certain materials; why this is i will elaborate further on at a later stage.

The photovoltaic (PV) effect, and subsequently photoelectrocemistry, was discovered only a few decades later in 1839 by Edmond Becquerel when he was able to detect a voltage between a solid material and a liquid electrolyte under illumination. \citep{Becquerel1839}

%Already in 1839, A. E. Becquerel reported observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte when struck by light, the photovoltaic effect

%Another important milestone in the history of semiconductors comes with Ferdinand Braun in 1874 when he, at the age of 24, discover the rectification effect at the point of contact between metals and certain crystal materials. This discovery would not find its practical use until the early 1900's when it became an essential part in the development of the radio. This discovery earned Braun the Nobel Prize in physics in 1909. 

\subsection{Understanding the Semiconductor}

The basic idea of semiconductors is easiest explained by showing how atoms and the corresponding electron energies behave when bonding to other atoms, going from single atom electron energies through more complex \textit{energy levels} in molecules to \textit{energy bands} in solids. Electrons are only allowed to occupy certain energies, or states, and weather these states are filled or not depends on the energy of the electron in question. The number of electrons allowed at given energies, or rather the density of allowed energies, \intextnote{insert DOS.plot} are called \textit{density of states}; DOS for short.

\caption{Schematics showing energy bands for different number of atoms}
\label{fig:energy_bands}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:energy_bands} depicts these allowed energies and show how they overlap to form bands when a high number of atoms come together to form a bulk material. The semiconductor is special in that energy bands are separated in the area around an important energy level called Fermi level, $E_F$, typically by \intextnote{insert number plus ref.} forming a gap in the allowed energies; this discontinuity is also observed in the DOS plot shown in fig \intextnote{ref DOS.plt}. 

To further discuss this concept this new parameter is introduced, namely the \textit{Fermi energy level}, $E_F$. Since electrons in solids obey \textit{Fermi-Dirac} statistics\footnote{Fermi-Dirac statistics builds on quantum mechanical principles such as indistinguishably of electrons and the wave nature of electrons. Further details on Fermi-Dirac statistics will not be given in this text. Readers are directed to more comprehensive texts on the subject, such as \citet{Schroeder1999} and \citet{Kittel2004}}  it is possible to show that the distribution of electrons over a range of allowed energies $E$ at thermal equilibrium is

\begin{align}
f(E) \eq \dfrac{1}{1+\exp{(E-E_F)/kT}}
\label{eq:fermi-dirac-distribution}
\end{align}

where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant\footnote{$k\eq 8.62\e{-5}\ben{eVK}^{-1}$}. Equation \ref{eq:fermi-dirac-distribution} gives the probability that an available state is filled or not at absolute temperature $T$. When $E\eq E_F$

\begin{align}
f(E) \eq \dfrac{1}{1+\exp{(E_F-E_F)/kT}} \eq \dfrac{1}{1+1} \eq \dfrac{1}{2}
\end{align}

the 'definition' of the Fermi energy level appears: the probability of having an electron occupy the energy state corresponding to the Fermi level is 50\%. \citep{Streetman2015} Another simplified way to explain Fermi energy level: the Fermi level equals the potential of electrons in the solid at 0 K. 




Semiconductors differs from other materials in that the bulk material have certain prohibited electron energy levels. When these atoms come together to form (typically) a crystal, the electron energy levels overlap and from energy levels

\subsection{Pourbaix Diagrams}

Pourbaix diagrams project multiple electrode and electrolyte conditions onto a two dimensional plane and provides information on the corroding conditions as first described by Marcel Pourbaix in his theses dated 1945 \citep{Pourbaix1945}. The two dimensional plot generally depicts three different areas of thermodynamic stability: immunity, passivity and corrosion  as shown in figure \ref{fig:pourbaix_generic}.

The \textit{immunity} zone describes the conditions where the metal itself is the stable phase and corrosion is non-existent. \textit{Passivity} describes the conditions under which the metal is passivated by formation of a coating, usually an oxide or hydroxide. In the corrosion zone, the thermodynamically stable species is a dissolved reaction product, namely metal cations suspended in the aqueous electrolyte \citep{Beverskog1995}.

In a two electrode set-up, one electrode would
